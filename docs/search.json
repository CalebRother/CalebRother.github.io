These picnic benches have been around for many years, but have not been properly maintained. I plan to bring students together to help me sand, repaint, and refinish the wooden picnic tables so our outdoor seating is once again maintained.\n\n\n“I See You”\nI am working with UNK Grounds to coordinate a time to help finish the “I See You” art exhibit in front of the Union by putting rock around the statues. We will also be laying sod, and will need student help to make quick work of this project.\n\n\nMen’s and Copeland Exterior\nMen’s Hall and Copeland Hall are a core part of UNK’s identity. Both often shown to prospective students in tours, and Men’s is home to the UNK Honors Program.

I plan to work with Tanner Cooper and HAO to pressure wash the exterior of Men’s Hall, and later work on cleaning Copeland.\n\n\nOtto Olsen Development\nI am currently proposing and acquiring funding for a development of the Northeast corner of the old Otto Olsen lot on campus.
